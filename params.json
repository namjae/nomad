Add nomad to your list of dependencies in mix.exs:\r\n\r\n          def deps do\r\n              [{:nomad, \"~> 0.5.1\"}]\r\n          end\r\n        or\r\n          def deps do \r\n              [{:nomad, github: \"sashaafm/nomad\" }]\r\n            end\r\n\r\n  2. Ensure nomad is started before your application:\r\n\r\n          def application do\r\n            [applications: [:nomad]]\r\n          end\r\n    \r\n  3. For every cloud provider you will need to add to your desired environment the following:\r\n\r\n         config :nomad, \r\n           cloud_provider: <provider_atom>\r\n           \r\n  4. Each provider needs different configurations\r\n     \r\n     To use **Amazon Web Services** the following configurations are needed:\r\n\r\n         config :nomad,\r\n           cloud_provider: :aws\r\n      \r\n     Then pass your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key as System variables when launching the application like so:\r\n\r\n         AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws_access_key_id> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_access_key>\r\n    \r\n     To use **Google Cloud Platofrm** the following configurations are needed:\r\n\r\n         config :nomad,\r\n           cloud_provider: :gcl\r\n    \r\n         config :goth, \r\n           json: \"config/creds.json\" |> Path.expand |> File.read!\r\n           \r\n     Where 'creds.json' is the JSON file with your account credentials that you may download from your Google Cloud Console. Alternatively you may name the file whatever you want as long as you change the config accordingly.\r\n     \r\nThe atom passed in the **:cloud_provider** key will tell Nomad what API function blocks will need to be generated.",
